What I needed to accomplish the task:
* Computer- Obviously! :)
* CRA - Create React App
* Bootstrap React
* Node.js (latest version)
* Visual Studio
* GitHub

### How to Bootstrap the App

First download the latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime enviroment.

Next you need to do is install the bootstrap in your command line:
```
npm install bootstrap
```

Alternatively you may use yarn:

```
yarn add bootstrap
```

Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your src/index.js file:
```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your
// components takes precedence over default styles.
```

Here is the [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/) on how to add bootstrap to a React website.

#### To start your project

To get started immediately on the project, do the following in your command line:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

It will automatically open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.
