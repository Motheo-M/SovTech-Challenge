## SovTech Challenge

What I needed to accomplish the task:
* Computer- Obviously! :)
* CRA - Create React App
* Bootstrap React
* Node.js (latest version)
* Visual Studio
* GitHub

### How to Bootstrap the App

Here is the [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/) on how to add bootstrap to a React website.

The first you need to do is install the bootstrap in your command line:
``` npm install bootstrap ```
